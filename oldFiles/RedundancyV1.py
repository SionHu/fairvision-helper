"""
This is the first version of the code to reduce redundancy for the attributes given by the users.
The code uses SpaCy to find similarities. The code assumes the model is given as a param for the initializer.
About the model used -> English multi-task CNN trained on OntoNotes, with GloVe vectors trained on Common Crawl.
Assigns word vectors, context-specific token vectors, POS tags, dependency parse and named entities.
Model Name  - en_core_web_md
