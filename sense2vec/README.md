### Notes
* Some large pre-trained vectors are not included. Download  from the [Sense2Vec official website](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec) section below.
* The `s2v_reddit_2015_md` has been tested and working fine. The 2019 one is just too large and I didn't want to spend too much time to download them. 


### Pretrained vectors

To use the vectors, download the archive(s) and pass the extracted directory to
`Sense2Vec.from_disk` or `Sense2VecComponent.from_disk`. The vector files are
**attached to the GitHub release**. Large files have been split into multi-part
downloads.
